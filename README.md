# RAIL FENCE CIPHER
Rail Fence Cipher is a simple transposition cipher that encrypts plaintext by rearranging its letters in a zigzag pattern. 
The name "rail fence" comes from the way the ciphertext is written out in a pattern that resembles the rails of a fence.

To apply the Rail Fence Cipher, first, the plaintext is written in a diagonal pattern across a set number of "rails" or rows. 
The ciphertext is then read off in rows, by traversing the zigzag pattern that is created. 
The number of rails used corresponds to the length of the key used to encrypt the plaintext.
